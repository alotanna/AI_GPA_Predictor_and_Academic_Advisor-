GPA Predictor and Academic Advisor Web App
Project Overview
This project aims to create a web application that enables individuals in the academic community—including students, teachers, and parents—to predict grade point averages (GPA) based on essential parameters such as:
- Study Hours
- Previous GPA
- Physical Activity
- Stress Levels
- Educational Resources
- Nutrition
- Sleep Patterns
- Time Wasted on Social Media
Methodology
Our approach involves training an artificial neural network (ANN) with relevant data to predict GPA values. These predicted values are then passed to a pre-trained Open-source "Cohere" language model(Command-Xlarge API) to provide personalized advice based on the relevant features influencing the GPA prediction. The advice is displayed in the following format:
General Impression
"Based on the information provided, it seems..."
Academic Performance
Study Hours: While studying for more hours is beneficial, ensure you maintain a balance to avoid burnout.
Use of Available Resources: Despite limited educational resources, maximizing their use can significantly impact your performance.
Well-being
Improve Nutrition: A low level of nutrition can negatively impact your academic performance. Aim for a balanced diet.
Increase Physical Activity: Aim to increase your physical activity to boost both physical and mental health.
Limit Social Media Time: Excessive time on social media can detract from study time and impact your grades.
